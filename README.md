### A REPORT ON ANALYSIS AND PREDICTION OF SURVIVORS ON THE TITANIC
#### Problem statement:
The RMS Titanic, a luxury steamship, sank in the early hours of April 15, 1912 off the coast of Newfoundland in the North Atlantic after sideswiping an iceberg during its maiden voyage.
Of the 2,240 passengers and crew on board, more than 1,500 lost their lives in the disaster. 
The goal of this project is to perform an analysis of the survival of the passengers based on the features available in the titanic dataset.

#### Scope:
•	The titanic dataset contains data about 418 passengers and 12 features. 

•	Since this dataset contains information of only a limited number of passengers, all the analysis and predictions made are only for the group of passengers given in the dataset.

•	This project can be extended by increasing the number of input parameters and by using several advanced machine learning algorithms and perform more effective predictions.

#### Dataset Description:

•	PassengerId 

•	Survived – (Yes=1, No=0)

•	Pclass – Passenger Class (Class 1 = 1, Class 2 = 2, Class 3 = 3)

•	Name – Name of the Passenger

•	Sex – (male or female)

•	Age – Age of the passenger in years

•	Sibsp – Number of siblings or spouses aboard

•	Parch – Number of parents or children aboard

•	Ticket – Ticket number

•	Fare 

•	Cabin

•	Embarked – Port of embarkation (Q-Queenstown, C-Cherbourg, S-Southampton)
